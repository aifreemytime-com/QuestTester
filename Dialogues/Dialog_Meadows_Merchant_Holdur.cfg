[dialog_holdurs_cousins]
You might be thinking of my cousin Haldor: he is short, never shares his pipe, and sometimes swears at humans that don't understand our tongue. Or maybe my cousin Hildir? She's much more fashionable and always out to make you do her dirty work. I do wish both of them would eat a healthier diet like I do. I find them annoying, but their loxen are nice! All that is radda ga-drabble, as they say. Anything else that interests you?
