[mushroom_queen]
Greetings! I, Rhaenyra the Mushroom Queen, offer rare commodities indeed! My wares all require magical blue mushrooms. Some obtain these through quests, or participating in community events. Others will trade for them... I have heard tell that farmer's produce is in the highest demand; perhaps you should consider toiling in your field and barter for blue mushrooms from valiant adventurers.
