[transmog_gretel]
I cast illusions and glamours upon your equipment and apparel, allowing your fashion to reflect your personal style. The changes I make are purely aesthetic, and shall not change the way in which your possesions work. Buyer beware!  Batteries not included, terms and conditions apply. Only if you ask, will I give you a preview of the new look. Not all looks take color well, especially those that begin in darker shades. To see the changes, you must take the thing off or put it away before donning or weilding it again. These spells require a soul within to be seen and shall not work upon a stand.
