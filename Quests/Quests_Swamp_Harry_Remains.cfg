The Skins of Eikthyr's Children
These may be found all over the world! I care not whether you slay them yourself or steal them where you can. Inexpensive, but still somewhat useful.

Squirming Lizard Tails
Ooo, I love when the are still wriggling, but they will rot just fine even if the galvinization energies have been expended.

From the Pits of Helheim
A highly viscous and toxic goo forged under the unimaginably heavy weight of the land itself. It is rot in its most extreme form, made from the bodies of those that time has forgotten. I like to sip it while reading the morning runes.

Holes to the Beyond
It is said that if you gaze into the abyss, the abyss gazes back. These grow from spores planted in the graves of humankind in the dark of the thick forest. My brethren sew them daily. Most only grow one, corrupt svartalf but there are places where they bloom into so much more!

Magically Delicious
Toxic to the living, and a poison to the soul. It is little wonder that fuling shaman seek them out; for to hollow out a portion of one's quintessential spirit leaves room for the corruption of their sorcerous ancestor.

Rotten Stumps
One day, way back when, the leftovers of human logging that were swallowed by the bogs took on an undeath of their own. They are greater than the sum of their parts, to be sure. Steeping them in a tea is a salve to the animate dead.

My Masters' Childer
I have heard that vikings such as yourself have some use for them. If I am outbid, then so be it. As to what I shall do with them: the Masters consumes his own brood. Sacrificing the self to the self. I shall return them to from whence they came! ...Or maybe make a nice jello.

Briny Parasites
It is unfortunate that the great leviathans so rarely die. Even so, my sistren and brethren comb the seabed hoping to find the deomposing remains of these great beasts and harvest these parasites from their shells. If only more of my kind were as cognitively present as I am; we would sail the great ships as we once did long ago.

Armor of the Great Infestation
The hardened shells of the ever-hungry hive decompose into an ingredient for an essential and poisonous bonding material. What sets me apart from others like me is my brightly burning mind, but also the longevity regimen that this reagent enables. Find gladness in your heart that I have uses for the living, or else I should be a foe to rival, perhaps even exceed, My Masters --for I am unbreakable. I also send the lesser denizens of the bogs to use this to seal out the stinking waters from our murky catacombs.
