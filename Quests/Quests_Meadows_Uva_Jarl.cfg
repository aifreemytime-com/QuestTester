Find Ulf the Bold
The village idiot, Ulf, often needs help. He is bold... So bold. That being said he is no philosopher. He dotes on a woman who did not reflect his affections, even going so far as to challenge her lover to a duel, and thus she left the village, and now Ulf is even worse for it. I fear the damage to his head and heart have left him even worse off. If you would look after him, the village shall take care you.

Find Holdur the Broker
He is a little, blue man with business ties all over Valheim. When he washed ashore here we thought him strange, but he has come to be the heart of Beeheim Village. He is a good man to know, and will help you to find buyers for your goods or point out good deals for you to consider when you're in the market.

Find Gretel the Illusionist
Gretel is a woman with an artistic approach to magick. She can help you to develop your own style so that you needn't look like an urchin with no more imagination than Ulf. She can make your weapons and clothing look unique, although her magicks do not always result in the desired effect. Be sure to listen to her before blindly demanding changes.

Find Rhaenyra the Celestial
We have come to believe that Rhaenyra is a lesser goddess, perhaps descended from Frigg, or Baldur. Though she keeps to herself, she creates unusual items of all sorts, and can make even the most powerful arms and armor even stronger!
